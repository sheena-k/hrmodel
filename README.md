## Abstract:

HR analytics involves collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to various HR functions. This study delves into the intricate landscape of Human Resources (HR) by leveraging a rich and extensive dataset. The dataset encompasses diverse facets of HR functions, including employee demographics, recruitment processes, performance evaluations, training initiatives, and employee satisfaction metrics.This project is about an MNC which is active in Big Data and Data Science.

The Organization wants to hire Data Scientists among candidates who successfully passed some of the courses which are being offered by the company. Many people signup for their training. The Organization wants to know which of these candidates really wants to work for the company after training or will look for a new employment, because this analysis helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates.

Multiple attributes have been provided regarding candidateâ€™s previous experience and the level of education they have and on which domain they had qualified. The types of company they had worked in and their work experience (in years) in the company, and the training hours they had completed. The company wants to know about the candidates working habit, so they have collected data about the difference in years between previous job and current job of the candidates.
