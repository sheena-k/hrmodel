## Abstract:

i) Developed a predictive model that classifies whether a person is looking for a job change or not. \n\n
ii) Experimentation has been done with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests. Random Forest produced an optimal model with an accuracy of 88%.\n\n
iii) Analyzed the importance of different features in predicting credit scores. This can provide insights into the factors which are most influential.\n\n
iv) Deployed the trained model in a production environment for making predictions on new data.\n\n

Supervised Machine Learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
Model Deployment Platform: Python Flask, Code Space, Render.com.
